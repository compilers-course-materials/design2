# Written 2 â€“ Functions and Memory

## Heap-allocated Stack Frames and Linked Closures

Consider this alternate stack layout strategy for allocating function call
information:

1. When a closure is _created_, no longer store the count of free variables or
the values of free variables themselves.  Instead, store two other words:

      - One that contains the number of _local variables_ in the function
      - Another that contains the address of the current frame object (described
        momentarily)

    ```
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    | 101 |  0  |  frame ptr  | #locals | arity  | code ptr |
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    ```


2.  When _calling_ a function, the caller allocates a _frame object_ on the
heap, with tag `011`, GC word `0`, a size counter equal to `arity` + `#locals`,
a _previous pointer_ that is set to the _closure's_ frame pointer, and space
for `arity` + `#locals` elements:

    ```
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    | 011 |  0  |  size  |  prev ptr | element1  | ... | maybe padding |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

    Then, push onto the stack the address of this frame object, copy the
    arguments to the call into the first `arity` elements.  Then `call` the
    function.


3.  When _called_, a function pushes the current value of `EBP`, and then sets
`EBP` to the address of the frame object it was passed.  All local variable and
argument references are performed by offset from `EBP` into the frame object.
Instead of restoring free variables from the closure onto the stack, free
variables are compiled to use the _previous pointer_ to look up the correct
location.  (This means that for each variable, compiler will track how many
nested `lambda` expressions above it was bound in, and traverse that many
previous pointers to find it.)

4.  When the main program starts, it allocates a frame object for the main
expression's variables, and puts that address in `EBP`.

The net effect of these changes is to put all function call information (other
than return pointers) on the _heap_.


### Question A:

For each of the following scenarios, discuss the tradeoffs this approach would
have in terms of memory and time needed:

- Evaluating a function body that creates 10 closures, each of which refers to
  5 free variables.  For example:

  ```
  let f = (lambda a, b, c, d, e:
    let g0 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g1 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g2 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g3 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g4 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g5 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g6 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g7 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g8 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e),
        g9 = (lambda: a + b + c + d + e) in
    (g0, g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6, g7, g8, g9) in

  f(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)[0]()
  ```

- Evaluating a function body that was nested 5 functions deep and refers to a
  variable that was an argument to the outermost function repeatedly, for
  example:

  ```
  let f = (lambda x: (lambda: (lambda: (lambda: (lambda: x + x + x + x))))) in
  f(10)()()()()
  ```

### Question B:

Does this layout of function call information and closures afford us any more
flexibility in how we implement variables?  Why or why not?


## Variable-Arity Functions

Many languages support _variable-arity_ functions.  For example, in Python, an
asterisk before the final argument indicates that it will hold all additional
arguments that are provided.  If too few arguments are provided, it is still an
error.  See `variable.py` for some examples.

the implementation we've been using in
